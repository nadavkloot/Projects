# LA Cafe
I've decided to open a small robot-run cafe in Los Angeles. The project is promising but expensive, so my partners and myself decide to try to attract investors. They’re interested in the current market conditions—will we be able to maintain our success when the novelty of robot waiters wears off? I'm an analytics guru, so my partners have asked me to prepare some market research. I have open-source data on restaurants in LA.


The project includes the following stages:

- Data preprocessing.
- Exploratory data analysis.
- Main Analysis.
- User Profiling.
- Testing hypotheses.

### Main python libraries used:
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Plotly
