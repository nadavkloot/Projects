The gym chain Model Fitness is developing a customer interaction strategy based on analytical data. One of the most common problems the gym faces is customer churn. In order to fight churn, Model Fitness has digitized a number of its customer profiles. My task is to analyze them and come up with a customer retention strategy.

- Data preprocessing.
- Exploratory data analysis.
- Model Building.
- User Clustering.
- Conclusion.

### Main python libraries used:
