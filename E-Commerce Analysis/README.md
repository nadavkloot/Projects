# E-Commerce - Product Range Analysis
Our task is to analyze the product range of an online store that sells household goods. We'll identify the top-selling products, determine if seasonality affects sales, and more. By doing so, we'll allow the owners to make better decisions, which will ultimately lead to more revenue, better product selection, and a better user experience.

The project include the following stages:

- Data preprocessing.
- Exploratory data analysis.
- Categorization.
- Testing hypotheses.
- Dashboard.

### Main python libraries used:
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Plotly
