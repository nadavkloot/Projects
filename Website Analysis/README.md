# Website Analysis

I work at a startup that sells food products. I need to investigate user behavior for the company's app. First I'll study the sales funnel. I'll Find out how users reach the purchase stage. Then I'll look at the results of an A/A/B test. The designers would like to change the fonts for the entire app, but the managers are afraid the users might find the new design intimidating. I'll analyize the results, and write conclusions accordingly. 

The project include the following stages:

- Data preprocessing.
- Hypothesis prioritising.
- Cumulative analysis of a/b groups.
- Statistical analysis.

### Main python libraries used:
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Plotly
- Scipy.Stats
- Pingouin
