# AB Testing - Online Store

I am an analyst at a big online store. Together with the marketing department, i've compiled a list of hypotheses that may help boost revenue. My job is to prioritize these hypotheses, launch an A/B test, and analyze the results. My goal in this test is to discover which group is more beneficial, and to improve the buisness through it.

The project include the following stages:

- Data preprocessing.
- Hypothesis prioritising.
- Cumulative analysis of a/b groups.
- Statistical analysis.

### Main python libraries used:
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Scipy.Stats
